# DaftRentalBot

DaftRentalBot is an open source Python project that automates the process of applying for rental places on [daft.ie](https://www.daft.ie/) by scrapping latest ads every 30 seconds and applying for houses if not already.

## Features

-   Search for rental properties on daft.ie based on location, price range, number of bathrooms, number of bedrooms, and facilities. All the properties should be stored in `.env` file (template can be found [here](.env)) in root directory. All available options for each filter can be found [here.](available_filters.md)
-   Auto refreshes after every ~30 seconds to help you never miss the latest ads.
-   Can set no. of hours for which you want this bot to run.
-   Takes default values for each filter if not specified.
-   Apply to rental properties with a customizable application message
-   Keep a log of applied houses in the `logger.csv` file (example can be found [here](logger.csv)), including "Rent", "Address of the house", "Daft link to the house", and "Application status"
